# Selfie Station

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

This is a super simple Angular 4 application that was inspired by [this](https://jsfiddle.net/dannymarkov/cuumwch5/) demo of taking a snapshot in the browser.

It's intended to POST the snapshot along with a status of up to 280 characters to a microservice which then tweets it out to a particular Twitter feed.  

A simple use for this application might be for a conference or event to allow users to post a selfie from their event to the event's Twitter feed.
